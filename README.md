    1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
    - We will scrape the data and create a timetable.
    - The data will be split into two parts: data before a certain date will be used for training, and data after that date will be used for testing.
    2. Phase One: Traditional Model:
    - We will start with a traditional recommendation model using the simplest approach.
    3. Phase Two: Feature Addition:
    - We will enhance the model by adding features such as movie attributes and user genre preferences.
    4. Phase Three: User Connections:
    - In the final phase, we will incorporate user connections with other users.
    Comparison:
    - We will compare the results of all three phases to evaluate the performance improvements.
