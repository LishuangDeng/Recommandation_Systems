## 01 A-feed-forward-network-for-input-that-is-both-categorical-a_2002_Neural
-- Separate numerical features and categorical features to the neural network model.
-- Categorical features are added before the last layer.

## 02 Recommender Systems
-- The structure of this paper is similar to our papers.
-- It demonstrated the types of recommender systems (with rating-based and without rating-based), then fit the data into the model to check which model is the best.
-- Here they used two different movie data (Movielens and Netflix) to build each model and then to make a comparison.
-- With Rating-based: similarity-methods(Collaborative recommendations)
-- Without rating: network methods
-- Additionally, this paper summarized challenges in recommender systems domains. 
-- Summary see the word file.
